# My Dotfiles!
There are many like it but these are mine.

Okay but hear me out, they're actually pretty nifty. These dotfiles configure all my computers, desktops and [servers](https://turb.io) alike. Mostly it's just a bunch of [nix](https://nixos.org/), the specific config is selected by `hostname.nix` (not checked in) with individual host configs under `/hosts`.
